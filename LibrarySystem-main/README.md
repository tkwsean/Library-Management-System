# LibrarySystem

This project simulates a library system with functions that one would expect to see at a library.

Features:

- The librarian (the user) scans CSV files containing a list of books and a list of students into the library system. 

- Students can log into the system with their username and password. If they do not have an account, they can create one.

- Once logged in, students can search for books, check their status, or view all available books that are not loaned out.

- Books can be searched by its title, author, or ISBN number.
